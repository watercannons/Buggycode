We have written a small python function to test if a string is a palindrome, but it seems to fail on some of our cases! Two of the cases that should return True instead return False.

Figure out the bug and fix it so the palindrome function correctly identifies palindromes.

The following worksheet is here as a guide if you want it, but feel free to use it (or not) in any way you want.

-------

Which strings is palindrome failing on? Write them here.



Try setting a breakpoint on one of the lines with a failing test case, and step into the palindrome function. Does it go in to the base or recursive case?




If this function makes a recursive call, what are the arguments to this next call to `palindrome`? Does this seem correct? If not, how could you fix it?
