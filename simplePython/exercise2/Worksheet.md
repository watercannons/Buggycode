## Exercise 1

You have recently found yourself writing some programs which find the longest common substring of two strings. We have the same program for you, but our version has a bug in it! Please help us find it!

This is a worksheet to guide you in finding the bug, but feel free not to use it if you want to go off on your own!

You should download introExercise.py and run it in your debugger.

Which test cases fail? List them here.

<br></br>   


Try setting a breakpoint at one of the test cases and stepping into it. Which of the three conditional statements do you go into?

<br></br>


Does this seem like the right condition based on the comments?

<br></br>


Try restarting and stepping to the second if statement. What are `s1[0:]` and `s2[0:]`?

<br></br>


Does this condition seem like itâ€™s testing what it claims to be testing in the comment? If no, you should probably change the code so that it does!
