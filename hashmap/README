Buggy Multi-thread Hash Table

There was a problem with a thread safe hash table. The person who found the bug (John) created a bit of test code.
Tabledemo.cpp is the driver for the multi threaded hash table which John used to recreate the bug. John said that
sometimes the assert statements in the driver code fail but not on every run. It will look something like 
```
	hashTest: tabledemo.cpp:111: void* workerThread(void*): Assertion `temp!=""' failed.
	Aborted (core dumped)
```
Good luck debugging the code!
